OPTIONAL TODOS, FOR WHEN AFTER THE APP IS "FINISHED":

- allow pokemon to be filtered by type
- add a button next to the main ability that shows a description of it. should be a small modal that only takes the space of that infoDiv
- make the shiny sprites button a toggle
- change pokemonProvider (or any component that uses more than 3 state variables) and change it into a reducer
- make all util functions be in one file

LUXURY TODOS, NOT ENTIRELY NECESSARY, BUT WOULD BE GOOD TO ADD THEM BEFORE THE APP IS "FINISHED" (MAYBES):

- add a linter
- instead of loading... get a loader
- do a revamp of the props each component takes. very specific components can use very specific props, generic components use generic props
- add another page, just to try react router a bit more
- possibly make the EvolutionChain be less ambigous

TODOS NECESSARY FOR THE APP TO BE "FINISHED":

- make the PokemonSmall look good on the Pokedex
- choose a color palette and apply it (hover color for the input, disabled buttons, etc)
  possible color palettes: persona 4, synthwave, pokemon

use ctrl+e for go to file
use the source control tab in vscode for easy commits to github
