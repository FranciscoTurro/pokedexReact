there is a sidebar that allows pokemon to be filtered by type (OPTIONAL)

add a button which opens a modal (?) and shows a description
of the main ability. has to fetch it (OPTIONAL)

make the shiny sprites button a toggle (OPTIONAL)

OPTIONAL, FOR ENDGAME (lol). pokemon provider uses way too much state, change it to a reducer

OPTIONAL. all util functions are in one file

P4G color palette (?)

maybe a linter, but check on reddit first

instead of loading... get a loader maybe if they are easy to implement

very specific components can use very specific props, generic components use generic
props. is autocompleteinput generic or specific?

maybe add another page, just to try react router a bit more

IMPORTANT make the PokemonSmall look good on the pokedex

IMPORTANT see if there's a way to make the evolution line be less confusing. you know, arrows and shit

use ctrl+e for go to file
use the source control tab in vscode for easy commits to github
