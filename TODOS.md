# WOULD BE GOOD TO ADD:

- add a button next to the main ability that shows a description of it. should be a small modal that only takes the space of that infoDiv
- change pokemonProvider (or any component that uses more than 3 state variables) and change it into a reducer
- make all util functions be in one file
- instead of 2 normal buttons put a png with the logo. settings for filter, a lightbulb for shiny
- add a linter
- instead of loading... get a loader
- do a revamp of the props each component takes. very specific components can use very specific props, generic components use generic props
- very small "bugs" with the autocompletion input, it doesnt follow the user when it uses the arrow keys, and a user can hover 2 things at once (one with mouse and one with keyboard). good practice because it was AI generated, so it would be good to go through it and try to figure it out
- look at the Pokedex return statement. keep code DRY
- evolution chain is too ambiguous
