# OPTIONAL TODOS, FOR WHEN AFTER THE APP IS "FINISHED":

- add a button next to the main ability that shows a description of it. should be a small modal that only takes the space of that infoDiv
- make the shiny sprites button a toggle
- change pokemonProvider (or any component that uses more than 3 state variables) and change it into a reducer
- make all util functions be in one file

# LUXURY TODOS, NOT ENTIRELY NECESSARY, BUT WOULD BE GOOD TO ADD THEM BEFORE THE APP IS "FINISHED" (MAYBES):

- add a linter
- instead of loading... get a loader
- do a revamp of the props each component takes. very specific components can use very specific props, generic components use generic props
- add another page, just to try react router a bit more
- very small "bugs" with the autocompletion input, it doesnt follow the user when it uses the arrow keys, and a user can hover 2 things at once (one with mouse and one with keyboard). good practice because it was AI generated, so it would be good to go through it and try to figure it out

# TODOS NECESSARY FOR THE APP TO BE "FINISHED":

- choose a color palette and apply it (hover colors, disabled buttons, components etc)
  possible color palettes: persona 4, synthwave, pokemon
- user can filter out pokemon by type. just filter out pokedex. dropdown menu from header i think
- evolution chain only shows what each pokemon can DIRECTLY evolve into

use ctrl+e for go to file
use the source control tab in vscode for easy commits to github
