there is a sidebar that allows pokemon to be filtered by type (OPTIONAL)

add a button which opens a modal (?) and shows a description
of the main ability. has to fetch it (OPTIONAL)

make the shiny sprites button a toggle (OPTIONAL)

OPTIONAL, FOR ENDGAME (lol). pokemon provider uses way too much state, change it to a reducer

P4G color palette (?)

IMPORTANT make the PokemonSmall look good on the pokedex

IMPORTANT: READ AND UNDERSTAND EVOLUTIONCHAIN AND AUTOCOMPLETEINPUT FFS.
grab pen and paper and understand the recursion in getEvolutions

instead of loading... get a loader maybe if they are easy to implement

maybe a linter, but check on reddit first

immediate issues: 
problems with urshifu evolution line 
user can sync out the evolution line if he clicks next/previous fast and out of order 
scrollbars are kind of fucky in pokemon extended (2em padding bottom)
see if there's a way to make the evolution line be less confusing. you know, arrows and shit

use ctrl+e for go to file
use the source control tab in vscode for easy commits to github
