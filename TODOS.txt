navbar that lets you go home and has an input to search. it has autocompletion.
searching for a pokemon and hitting enter gets you extended information 

homepage has 10 pokemon and a button to get the next 10 and a button to get the previous 10
find a way to add numbers to each page (page 1 is pokemon 1-20, page 2 is 21-40)

it is possible to click on each pokemon to get extended information

P4G color palette

there is a sidebar that allows pokemon to be filtered by type (OPTIONAL)

IMPORTANT: To slightly fix the pagination issue, try to make it so
that the next and previous button dont exist anymore, click on a button that 
ADDS new pokemon to the screen. really good idea, state variable that goes
into how many the api shows. if the user clicks on a button that numbers
goes up by like 50 or something.
