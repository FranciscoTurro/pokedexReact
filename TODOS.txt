there is a sidebar that allows pokemon to be filtered by type (OPTIONAL)

add a button which opens a modal (?) and shows a description
of the main ability. has to fetch it (OPTIONAL)

make the shiny sprites button a toggle (OPTIONAL)

OPTIONAL, FOR ENDGAME (lol). pokemon provider uses way too much state, change it to a reducer

P4G color palette (?)

IMPORTANT make the PokemonSmall look good on the pokedex

IMPORTANT add evolution chain to the bottom of pokemonExtended, too much unused space. 
1. Fetch the pokemon-species: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/ivysaur
2. Look at .evolution_chain -> https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/1/
3. Fetch the chain: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/1/
4. Parse the JSON and get the full list of evolutions.

maybe a linter, but check on reddit first

instead of loading... get a loader maybe if they are easy to implement
